# Watermark Anything

A general-purpose watermarking system designed to embed invisible watermarks in images.

## Overview

- **Type**: General-purpose image watermarking
- **Approach**: Encoder-decoder neural network architecture
- **Applications**: Content authentication, copyright protection, deepfake detection

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision timm
```

### 2. Download Model Checkpoint

Place your Watermark Anything model checkpoint in the `models/` directory.

### 3. Prepare Watermarked Images

Generate watermarked images using the Watermark Anything encoder and place them in the `watermarked_images/` directory.

## Usage in Pipeline

The pipeline will:
1. Load the model from the checkpoint in `models/`
2. Process images from `watermarked_images/`
3. Use the `msg_predict_inference` function to detect watermarks
4. Test robustness across various transformations

## Key Features

- **Flexibility**: Works with various image types and sizes
- **Capacity**: Can embed multiple bits of information
- **Detection**: Trained decoder extracts the embedded message

## Model Architecture

The system uses:
- **Encoder**: Embeds watermark bits into images
- **Decoder**: Extracts watermark bits from images
- **Training**: Adversarial training for robustness

## Configuration

Key parameters:
- `checkpoint_path`: Path to the model weights
- `device`: GPU or CPU for inference
- `batch_size`: Number of images to process simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Model not loading
- **Solution**: Verify checkpoint path and file integrity

**Issue**: Poor detection accuracy
- **Solution**: Check image quality and transformation parameters
